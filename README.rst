pyOCD
=====

pyOCD is an Open Source python 2.7 based library for programming and debugging 
ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers using CMSIS-DAP. Linux, OSX and Windows are 
supported.

You can use the following interfaces:

#. From a python interpretor:

   -  halt, step, resume execution
   -  read/write memory
   -  read/write block memory
   -  read-write core register
   -  set/remove hardware breakpoints
   -  flash new binary
   -  reset

#. From a GDB client, you have all the features provided by gdb:

   -  load a .elf file
   -  read/write memory
   -  read/write core register
   -  set/remove hardware breakpoints
   -  high level stepping
   -  ...

Installation
------------

The latest stable version of pyOCD may be done via  `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/index.html>`__ as follows:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install --pre -U pyocd

To install the latest development version (master branch), you can do
the following:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install --pre -U https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD/archive/master.zip

Note that you may run into permissions issues running these commands.
You have a few options here:

#. Run with ``sudo -H`` to install pyOCD and dependencies globally
#. Specify the ``--user`` option to install local to your user
#. Run the command in a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__ 
   local to a specific project working set.

You can also install from source by cloning the git repository and running

.. code:: shell

    python setup.py install

Standalone GDB Server
---------------------

When you install pyOCD via pip, you should be able to execute the
following in order to start a GDB server powered by pyOCD:

.. code:: shell

    pyocd-gdbserver

You can get additional help by running ``pyocd-gdbserver --help``.

Recommended GDB and IDE setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GDB server works well with Eclipse and the GNU ARM Eclipse OpenOCD plug-in.
To view register the Embedded System Register Viewer plugin can be used.
These can be installed from inside eclipse using the following links:
GNU ARM Eclipse: http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates
Embedded System Register Viewer: http://embsysregview.sourceforge.net/update

The pyOCD gdb server executable will run as a drop in place replacement for
OpenOCD. If a supported mbed development board is being debugged the target
does not need to be specified, as pyOCD will automatically determine this.
If an external processor is being debugged then ``-t [processor]`` must
be added to the command line. For more information on setup see
`this post for OpenOCD <http://gnuarmeclipse.livius.net/blog/openocd-debugging/>`__

Development Setup
-----------------

PyOCD developers are recommended to setup a working environment using
`virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__. After cloning
the code, you can setup a virtualenv and install the PyOCD
dependencies for the current platform by doing the following:

.. code:: console

    $ virtualenv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

On Windows, the virtualenv would be activated by executing
``env\Scripts\activate``.

To run the unittests, you can execute the following.  Because of how
pytest searches for tests, specifying the directory is important as it
will otherwise attempt to run non-unit tests as well (which will
hang).

.. code:: console

    $ py.test pyOCD/test

To get code coverage results, do the following:

.. code:: console

    $ py.test --cov-report=html --cov=pyOCD pyOCD/test
    $ firefox htmlcov/index.html

Tests
~~~~~

A series of tests are provided in the test directory:

-  basic\_test.py: a simple test that checks:

   -  read/write core registers
   -  read/write memory
   -  stop/resume/step the execution
   -  reset the target
   -  erase pages
   -  flash a binary
    
-  gdb\_test.py: launch a gdbserver
-  gdb\_server.py: an enhanced version of gdbserver which provides the following options:

   -  "-p", "--port", help = "Write the port number that GDB server will open."
   -  "-b", "--board", help="Connect to board by board id."
   -  "-l", "--list", help = "List all connected boards."
   -  "-d", "--debug", help = "Set the level of system logging output."
   -  "-t", "--target", help = "Override target to debug."
   -  "-n", "--nobreak", help = "Disable halt at hardfault handler."
   -  "-r", "--reset-break", help = "Halt the target when reset."
   -  "-s", "--step-int", help = "Allow single stepping to step into interrupts."
   -  "-f", "--frequency", help = "Set the SWD clock frequency in Hz."
   -  "-o", "--persist", help = "Keep GDB server running even after remote has detached."
   -  "-bh", "--soft-bkpt-as-hard", help = "Replace software breakpoints with hardware breakpoints."
   -  "-ce", "--chip\_erase", help="Use chip erase when programming."
   -  "-se", "--sector\_erase", help="Use sector erase when programming."
   -  "-hp", "--hide\_progress", help = "Don't display programming progress."
   -  "-fp", "--fast\_program", help = "Use only the CRC of each page to determine if it already has the same data."

Hello World example code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from pyOCD.board import MbedBoard

    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

    board = MbedBoard.chooseBoard()

    target = board.target
    flash = board.flash
    target.resume()
    target.halt()

    print "pc: 0x%X" % target.readCoreRegister("pc")
    #    pc: 0xA64

    target.step()
    print "pc: 0x%X" % target.readCoreRegister("pc")
    #    pc: 0xA30

    target.step()
    print "pc: 0x%X" % target.readCoreRegister("pc")
    #   pc: 0xA32

    flash.flashBinary("binaries/l1_lpc1768.bin")
    print "pc: 0x%X" % target.readCoreRegister("pc")
    #   pc: 0x10000000

    target.reset()
    target.halt()
    print "pc: 0x%X" % target.readCoreRegister("pc")
    #   pc: 0xAAC

    board.uninit()

GDB server example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python:

.. code:: python

    from pyOCD.gdbserver import GDBServer
    from pyOCD.board import MbedBoard

    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

    board = MbedBoard.chooseBoard()

    # start gdbserver
    gdb = GDBServer(board, 3333)

gdb server:

::

    arm-none-eabi-gdb basic.elf

    <gdb> target remote localhost:3333
    <gdb> load
    <gdb> continue

Architecture
------------
Target
~~~~~~

A target defines basic functionalities such as ``step``, ``resume``, ``halt``,
``readMemory``, etc. You can inherit from Target to implement your own methods.

Then declare your target in TARGET (in ``pyOCD.target.__init__.py``)

Transport
~~~~~~~~~

Defines the transport used to communicate. In particular, you can find CMSIS-DAP.
Implements methods such as ``memWriteAP``, ``memReadAP``, ``writeDP``, ``readDP``, ...

You can inherit from ``Transport`` and implement your own methods.
Then declare your transport in ``TRANSPORT`` (in ``pyOCD.transport.__init__.py``)

Flash
~~~~~

Contains flash algorithm in order to flash a new binary into the target.

gdbserver
~~~~~~~~~
Start a GDB server. The server listens on a specific port. You can then
connect a GDB client to it and debug/program the target.

Then you can debug a board which is composed by an interface, a target, a transport and a flash
