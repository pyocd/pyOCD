    If you need file programming, either binary files or other formats, please see the

    This manager provides a simple interface to programming data that may cross memory
    region boundaries. To use it, create an instance and pass in the session object. Then call
    add_data() for each chunk of binary data you need to write. When all data is added, call the
    commit() method to write everything to memory. You may reuse a single MemoryLoader instance for
    multiple add-commit sequences.

    When programming across multiple regions, progress reports are combined so that only a
    one progress output is reported. Similarly, the programming performance report for each region
    is suppresed and a combined report is logged.

    Internally, MemoryBuilder instances are used to buffer data to be written to different types of memory.
    FlashBuilder is used to optimise programming within flash memory regions. RAM regions are programmed
    using the much simpler RamBuilder.
